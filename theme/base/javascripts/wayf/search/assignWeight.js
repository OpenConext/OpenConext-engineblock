 * Searches an array of idps for a given searchTerm.

 * - title
 * - entityId
 * - keywords

 * A weight is set for each entityId according to how well it matches:
 * - perfect match: title = 100, id & keyword = 60
 * - partial match: title = 30, id = 20, keyword = 25
 * If a perfect match is found, the search stops for that idp.
 *
 * NOTE: please also adjust the tests when changing the weights.
