  In order to explain my login problem's to the helpdesk
  As a user
  I need to see useful error information when something goes wrong

  Background:
    Given an EngineBlock instance on "vm.openconext.org"
      And no registered SPs
      And no registered Idps
      And an Identity Provider named "Dummy Idp"
      And the IdP uses a blacklist for access control
      And a Service Provider named "Dummy SP"
      And a Service Provider named "Connected SP"
      And SP "Connected SP" uses a blacklist for access control
      And a Service Provider named "Unconnected SP"
      And SP "Unconnected SP" uses a whitelist for access control
      And an unregistered Service Provider named "Unregistered SP"

  Scenario: I log in at my Identity Provider, but something goes wrong and it returns an error response.
    Given the IdP is configured to always return Responses with StatusCode Requester/InvalidNameIDPolicy
      And the IdP is configured to always return Responses with StatusMessage "NameIdPolicy is invalid"
     When I log in at "Dummy SP"
      And I pass through EngineBlock

     When I log in at "Dummy SP"
      And I pass through EngineBlock
      And I pass through the IdP

    Given the IdP is configured to always return Responses with StatusCode Responder/RequestDenied
      And the IdP is configured to always return Responses with StatusMessage "Invalid IP range"
      And the IdP is configured to not send an Assertion
     When I log in at "Dummy SP"

     When I log in at "Dummy SP"
      And I pass through EngineBlock
      And I pass through the IdP

  Scenario: An SP sends a AuthnRequest transparently for an IdP that doesn't exist
     When I log in at SP "Dummy SP" which attempts to preselect nonexistent IdP "DoesNotExist"

      And I should see "Timestamp:"
      And I should see "Unique Request Id:"
      And I should see "User Agent:"
      And I should see "IP Address:"

    Then I should see "your session was lost"

  Scenario: The session has been lost after logging in at the SP
    When I log in at "Dummy SP"
     And I lose my session
