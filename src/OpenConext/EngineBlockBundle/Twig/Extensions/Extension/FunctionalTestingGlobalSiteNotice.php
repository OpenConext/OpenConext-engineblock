<p>
    There is nothing wrong with your television set.
    <strong>Do not attempt to adjust the picture.</strong>
    We are controlling transmission. If we wish to make it louder, we will bring up the volume.
    If we wish to make it softer, we will tune it to a whisper. We will control the horizontal.
    We will control the vertical.  We can roll the image, make it flutter.
    We can change the focus to a soft blur, or sharpen it to crystal clarity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.</strong>
    We repeat: There is nothing wrong with your television set. You are about to participate in a great adventure.
    You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to... The Outer Limits.
