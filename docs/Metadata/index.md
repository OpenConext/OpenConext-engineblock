In this folder you can find several documents relating to the transformation of the internal EngineBlock Metadata

The following documents are available:

- [Metadata Structure][1], outlining the new metadata structure
- [Metadata json][2], outlining the JSON as it is being sent by Janus. Leading for what mustr be supported.
- [Questions and Findings][3], several open questions and remarks, things that deserve investigation
- [SamlEntity][4], a (deprecated) document about the transformation of metadata representation and storage
