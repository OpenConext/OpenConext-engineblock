* BACKLOG-1081 Improve error handling of SAML login in HTML frame (third party cookies)
    Improve the error message when third party cookies (like a HTML frame) prevent SSO.

    EngineBlock_X509Certificate strips new lines and spaces and now also tabs out of the certificate.

    EngineBlock uses the ARP to determine which attributes are returned to the SP. There are now three options:
    - Wildcard ('*') meaning any value is allowed
    - Exact match meaning the attribute value from the IdP must be an exact match with the configured value in the ARP
    - Prefix matching meaning the attribute value from the IdP must start with the configured value in the ARP
