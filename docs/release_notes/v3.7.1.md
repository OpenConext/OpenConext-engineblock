# SURFnet SURFconext v3.7.1 Release Notes #

Bugfix release

* BACKLOG-1095 Consent screen improvements
    The name ID was shown in the consent screen. This is only allowed when the format is not transient
    (see https://wiki.surfnetlabs.nl/display/conextdocumentation/Consent+screen+improvements). This has been fixed by never showing the
    name ID as we don't know the format yet in the consent screen.

* BACKLOG-1078 WAYF improvements
    The changes in the WAYF - the possibility to mail to surfconext for non-connected IdP's - broke the debug WAYF
    (https://engine.demo.openconext.org/authentication/sp/debug). This has been fixed.
