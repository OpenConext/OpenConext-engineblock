This was achieved by removing it from the attributes.json. If you need it, please place it back in ./application/configs/attributes.json. See UPGRADING.md for details.

Also, EB now has Portuguese language support, and the allowed languages are configurable.

## 6.1.0
The metadata endpoints of EngineBlock have been under heavy maintenance in this release. Some highlights include the
move of all generation logic to the new Symfony EngineBlock application. But maybe more important, EngineBlock no longer
relies on entity information from the `sso_provider_roles_eb5` table. All EngineBlock metadata is either loaded from
ini config, or is hardcoded into the application. Because the Eb entities were purely an internal EB necessity you could
now remove them by removing them from Manage and then execute a metadata push.

The unused metadata entities are the following:
* engine.{{ base_domain}./authentication/sp/metadata
* engine.{{ base_domain}//authentication/idp/metadata

**Features**
 * Twig is used as template engine #759
 * User friendly errors are displayed when metadata can not be created #770 (resolves issue #211)

 * eduGAIN support was removed from the project #767
 * Remove unused metadatagetOrganizationUrlNl entities and logic #811

**Improvements**
 * Test coverage was a high priority (unit and functional tests are provided for every important feature) #766 #779 #780 #794 #795

**Other chores**
 * Third party dependencies: Doctrine ORM, PHPUnit, Phake and Mockery have been updated  #764 #777
 * Update ChromeDriver to match Chrome version #793
 * The dev and test cache locations have been moved to a location outside the project directory #780
 * Technical documentation was added to the wiki.

## 6.0.2

**Bugfix**
 * Fix namespace after cherry picked bugfix #820


## 6.0.1
This release is a bugfix release to prevent the 5.13 release from becoming broken after migrations running the migrations in the 5.13 release.
The migratoins dropped columns which still were in  use by 5.13 and is needed to support the rolling updates.

**Bugfix**
 * Remove migration to support 5.13 #817
 * Prevent invalid assertion when stepup LoA is set #819


## 6.0.0
In this release, PHP 5.6 support was dropped in favour of PHP 7.2. We are not migrating to the latest PHP version for some reasons. Chief amongst which is that PHP 7.2 was best compatible with the current EngineBlock code base.
An upgrade to 7.3 or even 7.4 would force us to upgrade many third party dependencies at the same time, making this release much bigger.

For installation instructions, see the UPGRADING.md entry for this version.

The following changes where introduced in this release:

**Improvements**
* PHP 7.2 compatibility changes #713

## 5.12.0
We've changed the way how coin entity properties are stored in the database. As of now, they will be stored in a serialized manner, in a single column. This greatly simplifies adding or removing coins in the future, as this no longer requires database schema changes.

## 5.11.3
The footer links have been made configurable to a greater extent in this release.

The most notable changes are:
 * Grunt is no longer used, npm run scripts are used instead. #672
 * Theming has changed, allowing for more easy theme overrides for JS and Sass resources. [Wiki](https://github.com/OpenConext/OpenConext-engineblock/wiki/Development-Guidelines#theme-development)

release. This change was removed in this release and will be executed in 5.11.
